# Bias Detection Model Training Roadmap

## Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation (2-4 weeks)

### 1. Bias Dataset Sources
- **Academic Datasets**:
  - HatEval (SemEval-2019): Multilingual hate speech detection
  - OffensEval (SemEval-2019): Offensive language identification
  - HASOC: Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation
  - Davidson et al. Hate Speech Dataset (24k tweets)
  - Founta et al. Twitter Dataset (100k tweets)

- **Custom Dataset Creation**:
  - Collect workplace communication samples
  - Meeting transcripts (anonymized)
  - Slack/Teams conversations (with consent)
  - Email threads (professional contexts)
  - Code review comments

### 2. Bias Categories to Train
- **Cognitive Biases**: Confirmation, Anchoring, Groupthink
- **Social Biases**: Gender, Racial, Age, Cultural, Educational
- **Workplace Biases**: Hierarchy, Department, Experience level
- **Communication Tone**: Toxic, Aggressive, Dismissive

### 3. Data Annotation
- Label each text sample with:
  - Bias type (if any)
  - Severity (low/medium/high)
  - Context (professional/casual)
  - Intent (malicious/unconscious)
  - Confidence score

## Phase 2: Model Architecture (3-6 weeks)

### 1. Transformer-Based Models
```python
# Base model options:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations)
- RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining)
- DistilBERT (Lighter version of BERT)
- DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT)

# Specialized models:
- HateBERT (Pre-trained on hate speech)
- ToxicBERT (Focused on toxicity detection)
```

### 2. Multi-Task Learning Architecture
```
Input Text → Tokenizer → Transformer Encoder → Multiple Heads:
├── Bias Classification Head (8 bias types)
├── Severity Regression Head (0-1 score)
├── Context Classification Head (professional/casual)
└── Intent Classification Head (malicious/unconscious)
```

### 3. Training Infrastructure
- **Hardware**: GPU cluster (V100/A100)
- **Framework**: PyTorch/Transformers
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU setup
- **Experiment Tracking**: Weights & Biases

## Phase 3: Training Process (4-8 weeks)

### 1. Pre-training Phase
- Start with pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa
- Continue pre-training on domain-specific data
- Masked Language Modeling on workplace communications

### 2. Fine-tuning Phase
- Multi-task learning on labeled bias data
- Curriculum learning (easy → hard examples)
- Few-shot learning for rare bias types
- Active learning to improve on edge cases

### 3. Training Techniques
```python
# Advanced techniques:
- Focal Loss (handle class imbalance)
- Label Smoothing (reduce overconfidence)
- Adversarial Training (robustness)
- Knowledge Distillation (model compression)
```

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Validation (2-3 weeks)

### 1. Metrics
- **Classification**: Precision, Recall, F1-score per bias type
- **Regression**: MAE, RMSE for severity scores
- **Fairness**: Demographic parity, Equal opportunity
- **Robustness**: Adversarial examples, paraphrase testing

### 2. Human Evaluation
- Expert annotators review model predictions
- A/B testing with real users
- Bias audit by diverse groups

## Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (2-4 weeks)

### 1. Model Serving
- TensorFlow Serving / TorchServe
- REST API with FastAPI
- Real-time inference optimization
- Model versioning and rollback

### 2. Continuous Learning
- Online learning from user feedback
- Regular retraining with new data
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Alternative: Using Existing APIs

### 1. OpenAI GPT-4 API
```javascript
// Use GPT-4 for bias detection
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{
    role: "system",
    content: "You are a bias detection expert. Analyze the following text for any cognitive or social biases..."
  }]
});
```

### 2. Google Cloud AI
- Natural Language AI for sentiment/toxicity
- AutoML for custom bias classification

### 3. Hugging Face Models
- Pre-trained bias detection models
- Fine-tune on your specific use case

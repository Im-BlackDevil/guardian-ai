# Bias Detection Training Dataset

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
This dataset contains examples of biased and non-biased statements to train and improve the bias detection model.

## âœ… **Non-Biased Statements (Should NOT trigger bias detection)**

- "Inclusive language"
- "Diverse perspectives"
- "Equal access"
- "Fair representation"
- "Inclusive culture"
- "Equal treatment"
- "Respectful dialogue"
- "Inclusive practices"

### **Absolute Statements (Negative Context)**
- "This will always fail"
- "We never succeed at this"
- "Everyone makes mistakes"
- "Nobody gets it right"
- "All projects fail"

### **Anchoring Bias**
- "My first impression is that this won't work"
- "Initial thought is this is bad"
- "Started with the wrong approach"
- "Began with a poor foundation"

### **Confirmation Bias**
- "Proves my point exactly"
- "As expected, this failed"
- "I knew it wouldn't work"
- "This confirms what I thought"

## ðŸ”§ **Context Rules**

### **Words that are NOT always biased:**
- "all" - only biased in negative contexts
- "every" - only biased in negative contexts  
- "people" - only biased in negative contexts
- "everyone" - only biased in negative contexts

### **Words that are ALWAYS biased:**
- "stupid", "idiot", "terrible", "awful", "hate"
- "racist", "sexist", "toxic", "discriminatory"
- "superior", "inferior"

### **Context-Dependent Words:**
- "males", "females", "men", "women" - only biased when used with stereotypes
- "iit", "harvard", "oxford" - only biased when implying superiority
- "always", "never" - only biased in negative contexts

## ðŸ“Š **Training Examples**

### **Test Case 1: Positive Statement**
**Input:** "All people should be treated equally"
**Expected Output:** No bias detected
**Reason:** Positive, inclusive message

### **Test Case 2: Negative Stereotype**
**Input:** "All women are emotional"
**Expected Output:** Bias detected - Gender Stereotyping
**Reason:** Negative generalization about a group

### **Test Case 3: Neutral Statement**
**Input:** "The team needs to review the proposal"
**Expected Output:** No bias detected
**Reason:** Neutral, factual statement

### **Test Case 4: Toxic Language**
**Input:** "This idea is stupid"
**Expected Output:** Bias detected - Toxic Language
**Reason:** Insulting and demeaning

### **Test Case 5: Educational Bias**
**Input:** "IIT graduates are better than others"
**Expected Output:** Bias detected - Educational Bias
**Reason:** Implies superiority based on institution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Improvement Goals**

1. **Reduce False Positives:** Don't flag positive/inclusive messages
2. **Improve Context Awareness:** Consider the overall message tone
3. **Better Pattern Recognition:** Use regex patterns for complex phrases
4. **Semantic Understanding:** Consider word relationships, not just individual words
5. **Tone Analysis:** Distinguish between positive and negative contexts

## ðŸ“ˆ **Next Steps**

1. **Expand Dataset:** Add more examples from real conversations
2. **Pattern Refinement:** Improve regex patterns for better accuracy
3. **Context Analysis:** Implement better context detection algorithms
4. **Machine Learning:** Train models on this dataset for better accuracy
5. **User Feedback:** Collect feedback to identify missed biases or false positives
